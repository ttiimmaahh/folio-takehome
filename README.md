# Folio Take-Home

A small document-sharing app. You'll be extending it with features that customers have been asking for.

---

## Submission notes

**What I built** (all three features, behind a small migration system):

1. **Scheduled publishing** — documents can have a future `publish_at`; before then the share link
   shows "Not yet available". Stored in UTC, displayed local (fixes a latent timezone bug).
2. **Human-readable IDs** — each document gets a readable slug (`welcome-packet`) that *complements*
   the share token rather than replacing it (recipient access stays token-only).
3. **Fuzzy search** — typo-tolerant search by title on the admin page.

Schema changes go through `migrations/*.sql` (a runner in `lib/migrate.php`); `schema.sql` is left
frozen. Document create, scheduling changes, and share creation are audit-logged. The full reasoning
and rejected alternatives are in **[`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md)**; agent/workflow setup is in
**[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)** and `.claude/`.

```bash
docker compose up                          # http://localhost:8000 (re-seeds a fresh db.sqlite)
docker compose exec app php tests/test.php # 10 tests, ≥1 per feature
docker compose exec app php migrate.php    # apply migrations standalone
```

## Setup

Requires Docker (with Compose). That's it — PHP, SQLite, and everything else ship inside the container.

```
docker compose up
```

Open http://localhost:8000. The first run builds the image (~30 seconds); subsequent runs start instantly.

Each `docker compose up` re-seeds `db.sqlite` from scratch, so you always start with a known state. Stop with `Ctrl+C`.

To run the tests:

```
docker compose exec app php tests/test.php
```

You edit files on your host machine in your normal editor — the container has them mounted, so changes show up immediately on browser refresh.

## Background

Folio is a small tool that lets staff create documents and share them with recipients via one-time links. This repo contains a staff admin page, document creation, share-link generation, and a recipient view. The schema (`schema.sql`) and helpers (`lib/bootstrap.php`) are meant to feel representative of a real internal tool.

Take some time to read the code before you start building.

## Agent setup

How you configure this repo for AI-assisted work is part of the exercise. That can include context files, permissions, hooks, custom commands, conventions to follow, orchestration (subagents, parallel tasks, custom skills or commands) — whatever fits how you work.

We're not prescribing specifics. Commit what you'd commit on a real project. If you decide setup isn't worth it for a three-hour exercise, say so in your video and explain why.

## Your Task

Customers have asked for three things. Pick an order, scope as you see fit, and build as much as you can in the time you have.

### 1. Scheduled publishing

Staff should be able to prepare a document in advance and have it become visible to recipients at a specific date and time. Before that time, someone hitting the share link should see a "not yet available" message instead of the document.

### 2. Human-readable document IDs

Today documents are identified by auto-increment integers (`#1`, `#2`) and share links use opaque hex tokens. Customers want each document to have a **short, readable ID** — something a person could say out loud, type into a URL, or paste into an email. Examples of the shape (not prescriptive): `welcome-2026`, `onboarding-packet-3k`, `FOLIO-7QX4`.

The exact format, length, and URL structure are your call. Think about collisions, guessability, and how this interacts with the existing share-token mechanism.

### 3. Share by name

Staff should be able to find a document to share by searching for it by title, not just by scrolling a list. Decide what "search" means here — exact match, prefix, fuzzy, something else — and justify your choice.

## What we're intentionally not specifying

- Whether readable IDs **replace** the existing share-token mechanism or **complement** it (there are real tradeoffs either way — privacy, guessability, link permanence)
- The URL structure for viewing a document
- How you structure and run schema migrations (see below)
- How the three features interact with each other

Make these calls yourself and explain your reasoning in your video. We care about your judgment as much as your code.

## Requirements

- **Schema changes go through a migration file (or files) you add to the repo**, not by editing `schema.sql` directly. There is no migration system yet — you decide how to organize one. Explain your approach in your video.
- At least one test covers each feature you build (see `tests/test.php` for the existing pattern).
- Document creation, scheduling changes, and share actions should be logged to `audit_log` (pattern is in `lib/bootstrap.php`).
- The `docker compose up` flow should still work from a fresh clone for anyone reviewing your branch.

## Deliverables

1. A branch with your changes and a commit log that tells the story of your work
2. A short video (~5 min) walking us through your approach, covering:
   - What you built and what you scoped out
   - The design decisions you made and the alternatives you rejected
   - Anything in the existing code you noticed worth flagging
   - What you'd do with more time
   - **Your AI workflow**: what you leaned on AI for, what you did yourself, a moment you pushed back on a suggestion, and anything you noticed about where AI helped or hurt
3. *(Optional)* Share chat transcripts or links if it's easy — a thoughtful minute in the video is worth more than an unedited log.

## Time

Budget ~3 hours. You probably won't finish all three features — **that's expected**. Prioritize, ship what you can finish well, and explain what you skipped and why. Partial + thoughtful beats rushed + complete.

## What we're looking for

- How you handle ambiguity (the spec is intentionally fuzzy)
- How you gather context before writing code
- How you set up and work with AI tools — including when you push back on their suggestions
- How you verify your own work
- How you communicate tradeoffs and anything surprising you found

Finished-but-sloppy loses to unfinished-but-thoughtful.
